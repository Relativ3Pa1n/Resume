I don’t have a traditional background in tech but I have worked very hard to be worthy of an opportunity in the tech field. 
Since the start of 2020 I have dedicated 100% of my time to Cyber Security. I started with the basics in 2020 and achieved my CompTIA Security+ and Network+ to prove it. In 2021 I started to sharpen my Ethical Hacking skills with a ton of different courses and online resources proving it with an OSCP certification. I have self funded this journey(including my trip to blackhat and defcon29) and continue to learn new technical aspects as well as new ways to share what I have learned with others. 
For instance, I most recently had an opportunity to participate in the DEFCON CTF on New years eve, featuring a Kubernetes cluster. Since the resource was on the public internet I leveraged a VPC to host a C2 server. This allowed me to create persistence in each of the pods that were present in the cluster. 
I am currently studying web app security and vulnerabilites to test for Portswigger academy and the OSWE. Otherwise, I’m studying clang and embedded systems. I'm active on hack the box and try hack me as well as various other CTF style platforms. I want to leverage what I have learned to benefit a team. I want to share my knowledge and learn from real world engagements. My dream is to one day part of a red team for full on adversary simulation.
